### Case Study: NICS Wellbeing

NICS Wellbeing is a Community Interest Company (CIC) established to support individuals with neurodiverse, mental, and physical health challenges. Led by co-founder Sabrina Ellis, NICS aims to reduce stigma, increase understanding of lived experiences, and create opportunities where people can contribute meaningfully. The organisation has a diverse team of volunteers, including Registered Mental Health Nurses, Teachers, Gardeners, and Psychologists, who collaborate to make a positive impact through solution-focused, community-driven initiatives. NICS is now entering its second year and aims to expand its reach by increasing funding, volunteer support, and the number of people it serves.

As NICS continues to grow, Sabrina and her team are exploring how AI tools and resources could help them enhance their operations, improve the services they provide, and ultimately make a bigger impact on the communities they serve.

#### Group Activity: Leveraging AI for Growth at NICS Wellbeing

In small groups, review the following scenario and questions. Think about how AI can be used to support NICS Wellbeing’s growth in funding, reach, and impact.

**Scenario:**
NICS Wellbeing wants to implement AI-driven solutions to optimise its workflows, improve community engagement, and provide better support to the people it serves. Sabrina Ellis is exploring ways to integrate AI into their operations but wants input on the most effective approaches. Your group is tasked with identifying AI use cases that could benefit NICS Wellbeing and answering key questions around AI integration.

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. **AI in Existing Workflows:**
   - What are some ways NICS Wellbeing could benefit from AI capabilities in their current workflows? For example, could AI help streamline volunteer coordination, track community engagement, or automate administrative tasks?
   
2. **Low-Code AI Tools:**
   - Does NICS Wellbeing have business process experts (e.g., Sabrina or key volunteers) who could use low-code AI tools to integrate AI into workflows without needing deep technical expertise?
   
3. **Custom AI Solutions:**
   - What kinds of custom AI solutions might NICS Wellbeing develop? Could AI be used to personalise support for people with diverse needs, or to predict trends in community health challenges?
   - Would these solutions be designed primarily for internal use (e.g., improving operations) or for external use (e.g., supporting their beneficiaries or partners)?
   
4. **Leveraging Data Science & Machine Learning Expertise:**
   - How could NICS Wellbeing leverage external data science and machine learning expertise to build and implement AI solutions? Could they partner with universities, research organisations, or volunteers with AI skills?
   
5. **Custom Models for NICS:**
   - What sorts of custom AI models might NICS Wellbeing build? For example, could they create models to predict the mental health needs of their community, optimise volunteer scheduling, or assess the impact of their programmes?

**Objective:** 
By the end of this activity, your group should identify at least two potential AI use cases for NICS Wellbeing and draft a brief plan for how AI can be integrated into their operations, either through low-code tools or custom AI solutions.

**Output:**
Each group will present their use cases and plans to the workshop, with a focus on how AI can support NICS Wellbeing’s mission and growth goals.
